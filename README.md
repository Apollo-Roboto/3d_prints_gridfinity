# 3d Prints For Gridfinity

This repository is a collection of 3d prints I made for Gridfinity.

I also have a repository of creations for the multiboard. [Check it out](https://github.com/Apollo-Roboto/3d_prints_multiboard/).

Each blender files should have an export script that will export the model in the proper format

Please avoid saving blend files with compression for git
